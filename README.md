## My Neovim configuration

Over 5k lines of "config" (~~it's alive at this point ðŸ˜ƒ~~)

I sincerely do not recommend using it. "*Why*" â†“
1. I do not plan on using it on Windows / macOS.
2. It has over 100 plugins by now and some weird binds that only work for me.
3. The folder / file structure is something only I understand by now ðŸ¤¨.
4. Just, why?

#### Some eye-candy photos ;)
