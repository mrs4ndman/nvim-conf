## My Neovim configuration

Around 4.5k lines of "config" (~~it's alive at this point 😃~~)

It's a setup I use for many things, a few to note:
- Markdown writing
- Java, Python, Rust programming
- Tweaking my other system configs

Anything text-related I mostly do it in Neovim

I sincerely do not recommend using it. "*Why?*" ↓
1. I do not plan on using it on Windows / macOS.
2. It has over 100 plugins by now and some weird binds that only work for me.
3. The folder / file structure is something only I understand by now 🤨.
4. Just, why?
